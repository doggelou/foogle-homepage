# Google Homepage

**HTML/CSS** project.

This is intended to be a clone of the Google's homepage and put HTML/CSS web dev skills into practice. I'll be adding corresponding hover effects, responsiveness to the page, and cleaning my messy code in the future but it's finished for now. It served well as a first approach and helped me understand basic HTML/CSS concepts like positioning and box model, among others.
